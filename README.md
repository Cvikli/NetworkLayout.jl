## Installation
``` julia
pkg> add NetworkLayout
```
## Algorithms
The available algorithms and their parameters can be found in the
[docs](https://juliagraphs.org/NetworkLayout.jl/stable).

All of the algorithms represent mappings `adjacency matrix â†¦ vector of
positions` where the positions are represented by the `Point` datatype from
[`GeometryBasics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/GeometryBasics.jl)

``` julia
using NetworkLayout
using Graphs

adj_matrix = adjacency_matrix(wheel_graph(10))

pos = spring(adj_matrix; iterations=20)
pos = algorithm(adj_matrix)
```
There is also a "delayed" functor version of each algorithm:
```julia
layout = Spring(; iterations=20)
pos = layout(adj_matrix)
```
Instead of passing a adjacency matrix on can also pass `Graphs.jl` graphs directly.
